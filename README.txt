This is a learning diary app with a console user interface.

The diary holds topics among other information, topics hold tasks among other information. Tasks hold notes among other information.

You navigate giving number commands and there are three levels to the app:

1 - main menu
	2 - topic menu
		3 - task menu

The app is missing lots of input validation and functionality still, but it should be usable.

The data is read from and saved to a file at startup and end.

The program is localized to English and Finnish.
